<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Shen Zhen Metro Stations are put into effect for several years, but the interaction between the users and management groups are still not that clear and direct so I created this enhanced one.


Here's what it is:
* Split-Stack-Developed an online metro application that includes a user system and a management system.
* Implemented authority management, subway management, statistical analysis, and line classification management.
* Using Spring Boot for the back-end, React+Hooks For the front-end, and Amazon S3 to store files.

Of course, no one website will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this website!
